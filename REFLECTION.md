1. Project Overview </br>
For this assignment, I used a Wikipedia article and 3 newspaper articles. I computed summary statistics to find the top 10 words used in the data. Before doing that, I cleaned the data by stripping punctuation, and prepositions from the text to obtain words that are integral to the main topic. I also conducted a sentiment analysis to see if the articles had a more negative tone or positive tone. What I hoped to learn from this was to see the difference in word choice and tone between a Wikipedia article and a news article. In addition, I wanted to compare the attributes mentioned previously among different media outlets such as the LA Times, BBC, and Times.
